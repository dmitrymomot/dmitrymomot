#### Theory:

- [Golang project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) - this is a basic layout for Go application projects. Has translations to 10+ languages.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/ua-nick/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) - several data structures and algorithms are implemented in Go.
- [System Design Interview](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/system-design-interview) - system design interview tips. This repository only teaches you how to handle the system design interview with a systematic approach in a short time.
- [The Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) - algorithms implementation in different languages, including [go](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Go).
- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) - is a community effort to create roadmaps, guides, and other educational content to help developers pick up the path and guide their learnings.
- [Awesome Go Educations](https://mehdihadeli.github.io/awesome-go-education/) - a curated list of awesome articles and resources for learning and practicing Golang and its related technologies.

#### Tools:

- [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) - generates type-safe code from SQL.
- [sql-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate) - SQL schema migration tool for Go. It can be used as a CLI tool and a library in your app.
- [mage](github.com/magefile/mage) - it's a make-like build tool using Go. You write plain-old go functions, and Mage automatically uses them as Makefile-like runnable targets.
- [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com) - it's a collaborative digital whiteboard. You can use tldraw to create a drop-in whiteboard for your product or as the foundation on which [to build](https://tldraw.dev) your own infinite canvas applications. The project is open-source, repository with code is [here](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).
