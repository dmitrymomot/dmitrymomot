#### Go (golang) packages:

- [go-app](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/go-app) - golang template for quick start a new application.
- [go-utils](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/go-utils) - some useful helpers I collect for years and use in each project.
- [go-pkg](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/go-pkg) - my another collection of code parts to speed up development, for example, HTTP server with a graceful shutdown, cqrs facade, etc.
- [oauth2-server](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/oauth2-server) - this is a simple OAuth2 server implementation in Go with some useful buns such as sign-in/sign-up/password recovery flows, API to manage user data and clients, token revocation, and introspection.
- [binder](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/binder) - HTTP request data binder (json, form data, query, file from multipart form).

#### Theory:

- [Golang project layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) - this is a basic layout for Go application projects. Has translations to 10+ languages.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/ua-nick/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) - there are several data structures and algorithms implemented in Go.
- [System Design Interview](https://github.com/dmitrymomot/system-design-interview) - system design interview tips. This repository only teaches you how to handle the system design interview with a systematic approach in a short time.

#### Tools:

- [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc) - generates type-safe code from SQL.
- [sql-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate) - SQL schema migration tool for Go. It can be used as a CLI tool and a library in your app.
- [mage](github.com/magefile/mage) - it's a make-like build tool using Go. You write plain-old go functions, and Mage automatically uses them as Makefile-like runnable targets.
